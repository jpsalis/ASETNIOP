ASETNIOP: A keyboard concept and layout designed by Zach Dennis in 2012. Its goal is to simplify typing on tablets and similar mobile devices by assigning each letter of the alphabet to a chorded pattern on the layout, where each finger has 1 and only 1 key to press.


Initial complications: 

The ASETNIOP layout is fairly consistent in how it works, but there are some discrepencies that need to be accounted for.
* Backspace doesn't work like a normal chord. It's activated by holding the 't' and 'p' at the same time. As long as you're holding both keys, it will hold the keypress so the OS can use repeat mode as necessary.


The ATMEGA 328P does not support USB peripheral mode, once I get out of the initial testing phase with serial port I have to port to some other processor that does, so my keyboard can natively be supported no matter what device I plug it into. I am considering the ATmega32u4
